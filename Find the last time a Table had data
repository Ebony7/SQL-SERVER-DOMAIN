Here is the query illustrates this technique;

SELECT DISTINCT
t.[name] AS [UserTableName],
[create_date] AS [CreatedDate],
[modify_date] AS [ModifiedDate]
FROM sys.tables t
JOIN sys.dm_db_partition_stats s
ON     t.object_id = s.object_id
AND t.type_desc = ‘USER_TABLE’
AND s.index_id IN (0, 1) –to include clustered index (1) or hash table (0)
ORDER BY 3 DESC 

Also, we can add a WHERE clause to limit the results to only to display, changes that have occurred in the last week, month, year, … Such as:

SELECT DISTINCT
t.[name] AS [UserTableName],
[create_date] AS [CreatedDate],
[modify_date] AS [ModifiedDate]
FROM sys.tables t
JOIN sys.dm_db_partition_stats s
ON     t.object_id = s.object_id
AND t.type_desc = ‘USER_TABLE’
AND s.index_id IN (0, 1) –to include clustered index (1) or hash table (0)
AND t.[name] IN (SELECT [name]
FROM sys.tables
WHERE ((DATEDIFF (d, create_date, GETDATE ()) =
1)
OR (DATEDIFF (d, modify_date, GETDATE ()) =
1))
AND (create_date <> modify_date)
)
ORDER BY 3 DESC
